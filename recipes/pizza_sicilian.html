        <!--Obviously if this was an actual recipe there would be numbers for the ingredients, but this is just The Food Lab's sicilian pizza and I don't want to rip them off. -->
        <ul>
            <li>flour</li>
            <li>water</li>
            <li>yeast</li>
            <li>olive oil</li>
            <li>sauce</li>
            <li>cheese</li>
            <li>pepperoni</li>
        </ul>
        <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the flour, yeast, and olive oil in the bowl for your mixer.</li>
            <li>Turn the mixer on low, slowly adding the water</li>
            <li>As the dough fully incorporates, turn the mixer to high. Mix on high for five minutes.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl of dough, set aside to proof for 1-2 hours. If you're making your sauce, possibly by following <a href="pizza_sauce.html">our recipe for a spicy pizza sauce</a>, this is a good time to do that</li>
            <li>After the dough has proofed, place the pizza stone (if using one) on the middle rack and preheat the oven to 450F. Pour the remaining olive oil on your half sheet, making sure that the sheet is completely covered</li>
            <li>Get some olive oil on your hands, then move the dough to the half sheet and carefully work it until it fully covers the pan, taking care not to tear the dough.</li>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of sauce over the crust. I like to use about 6-8oz.</li>
            <li>Take about two thirds of your pepperoni and spread them over the sauce.</li>
            <li>Evenly coat the pizza with cheese, making sure to go all the way to the edge of the pan.</li>
            <li>Place the remaining pepperoni over the cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake for 10-12 minutes or until cheese is golden.</li>
            <li>Remove, portion, and serve.</li>
        </ol>
